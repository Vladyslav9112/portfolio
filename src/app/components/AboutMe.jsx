      <p>
        I’m a Front-End Developer passionate about creating responsive,
        user-friendly websites with clean and well-structured code. I have solid
        knowledge of HTML, CSS, SCSS, Tailwind CSS, React, Next.js, TypeScript,
        and JavaScript, and I constantly stay up to date with the latest web
        technologies. I also have hands-on experience creating websites based on
        publicly available design resources, which has sharpened my skills in
        layout implementation and maintaining design accuracy. As a freelancer,
        I have completed front-end assignments for students enrolled in web
        development courses. Currently, I’m working at a company where I’m
        gaining real-world experience by collaborating with cross-functional
        teams and contributing to impactful projects. I’m confident in my
        problem-solving abilities, performance optimization skills, and
        dedication to delivering seamless, modern user experiences.
